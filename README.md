Yet Another Solar System (YASS)
====

YASS is a 3D Solar System made in C & OpenGL, for my 2nd 3D Programming class in Digital Games Development Engineering 

but, in a nutshell, the main key points about this project are:

* Object Oriented like code structure in C, through data hiding using incomplete types
* Simulation with real scientific data
* Some alpha blending sauce
* Neat GUI

Theres a presentation in [docs\YASS_EN.pptx](https://github.com/vvolkgang/YASS/blob/master/docs/YASS_EN.pptx) and in [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/alison_fernandes/yet-another-solar-system) with more information about the project.

To Compile
---------------
The code was made in Windows 7 + Visual Studio 2010. To compile it you will need:

* SOIL
* AntTweakBar
* GLUT
* bin/textures folder - with all the textures inside - next to the compiled .exe (app will crash on start if any texture isn't present)
