====

__Subject:__ 3D Programming, 2nd yr

__Course:__ Digital Games Development Engineering @ IPCA

__Description:__ 3D Solar System in C & OpenGL. First project of the abovementioned subject, enabling students to gain empirical experience with OpenGL API programming.

features
--------

* Object Oriented like code structure in C, through data hiding using incomplete types
* Simulation with real scientific data
* Some alpha blending sauce
* Neat GUI using AntTweakBar
* GLUT

For more in-depth information about the project, check the presentation in [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/alison_fernandes/yet-another-solar-system) or [docs\YASS_EN.pptx](https://github.com/vvolkgang/YASS/blob/master/docs/YASS_EN.pptx).

compilation
---------------
This repo has the compiled binaries tested on Windows 7 and 8. 
The code was created in Windows 7 + Visual Studio 2010. To compile it you will need:

* SOIL
* AntTweakBar
* GLUT
* bin/textures folder - with all the textures inside - next to the compiled .exe (app will crash on start if any texture isn't present)
